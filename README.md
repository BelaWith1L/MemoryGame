## Project Background

The starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project.  I converted the project from a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

If you'd like to view the detailed instructions,  you may look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Instructions

1. Click on a card to reveal the design/image on the other side.  The card design will stay visible.
2. Click on another card in the deck to reveal its image.
3. If the cards match, they change to a light green color and stay revealed.  If they do not match, the turn red and are flipped back over.
4. Using your memory, continue to reveal cards to form matches until all cards are correctly matched.
5. At this point, a congratulations message will appear, along with your time played and a star-rating. 
    <ol><li>a.. 16 moves or less = 3 stars</li>
    <li>b. 17-23 moves = 2 stars</li>
    <li>c. 24 or more moves = 1 star</li></ol>
6. To play the game again, click the spinning button.
7. If at any time you'd like to start over, you may click the spinning button above the deck, in the score card area.
